Let's go through the next incomplete section of @FormattingTODO.md
We're only doing one section. We stop after the section is done.

We're interactively updating eclipse formatter settings. Prompt with examples for each setting, I'll make a decision on the value (or to exclude if possible) the setting. Then we'll update the YAML config with this setting.

We'll go through this process for one section for now.

This TODO list is the source of truth for what is complete or not. If a setting exists inside the YAML, but the TODO list says it's not done, that means the setting isn't final and we need to prompt for it
Also note: Sometimes your examples with get cut off by the interactive prompt. So at the end of the examples put two blank lines like
```

/blank
```
Note: You MUST output at the end of every example before prompting. The prompt WILL cover your last two lines.
I won't see them, so this is needed.
