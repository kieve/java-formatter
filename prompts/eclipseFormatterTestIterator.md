Let's go through the next incomplete section of @prompts/eclipseFormatterTestChecklist.md
We're only doing one section. We stop after the section is done.

We're implementing tests for each of these settings, to make sure they're applied corectly.
@src/test/java/ca/kieve/formatter/eclipse/IndentationTabsTest.java has an example with the test
method `tabulationCharConvertsTabsToSpaces`

We'll go through this process for one section for now.

This TODO list is the source of truth for what is complete or not, but methods should have a comment
with the setting they map to.
