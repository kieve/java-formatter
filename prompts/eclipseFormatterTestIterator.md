Let's go through the next incomplete section of @prompts/eclipseFormatterTestChecklist.md
We're only doing one test. We stop after the test is created.

Each section gets its own file.

We're implementing tests for each of these settings, to make sure they're applied correctly.
@src/test/java/ca/kieve/formatter/eclipse/IndentationTabsTest.java has an example with the test
method `tabulationCharConvertsTabsToSpaces`

We'll go through this process for one test at a time.

This TODO list is the source of truth for what is complete or not, but methods should have a comment
with the setting they map to.
